# Alternative databases
Databases designed to store and work with big-data have gone through major changes from storing large amounts of structured data to store the ever-increasing amount of unstructured data that is being produced all the time on a global scale.

Relational databases are also called SQL (structured query language) databases and have a lot of limitations when it comes to storing data from multiple sources, IoT devices and real-time data streams since all of this data comes in an unstructured format.

So, NoSQL databases were introduced, these databases can store data in a variety of formats and provide a flexible structure that makes scaling easier. NoSQL databases are used in social media sites, IoT devices and AI models as well as in any other application that deals or produces large amounts of unstructured data. Unlike SQL, NoSQL databases come in a variety of types that include document-based, graph-based, and key-value (JSON) based options.
