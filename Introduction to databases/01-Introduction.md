# Introduction to databases
Databases are used in every digital application and all the information in the world is stored in some kind of a database. The importance of databases in real-life use cases are most of the time neglected since a lot of people don't know how important database engineering is in our modern-day world where everything needs to happen in a second.

The primary use of databases as the name suggest is to store data and different databases store different kinds and types of data. The database used in a bank is totally different from the one used to store data from a social media site. 

The huge rise of the IoT devices has led to a continuous stream of data that made advancements in database technologies necessary and real-time and graph databases were invented as well as the field of big-data in which data professionalsâ€™ study and work with data to make it more usable.
 
Whatever type of database there maybe they all do the same things if you look at it from an engineering perspective and that is to store data, form connections between different data, filter data, search data and allow engineers to manipulate the data. 

Some databases prefer speed over complex connections and some prefer vice versa. In order to choose the database that works best with your project you will need to analyze the requirements of the project and then choose the database that fulfills your criteria.
 
Databases and data itself are at the heart of all modern-day applications and if your system has a quick and reliable database then you and your user both will be happy since data can be stored easily and retrieved.
