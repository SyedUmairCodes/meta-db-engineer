# Relational charts
Data comes from different sources and is of different kinds and in order to make sense of it and explain it to other people like customers, stakeholders, managers and other people we use data to create charts that help in explaining what story the data is trying to tell.

Charts can convey a great deal of information and can capture peopleâ€™s attention in a way that helps them to make better decisions and take suitable actions.

## Bar charts
Bar charts are graphs that represent categorical data in rectangular bars and the height of the bars represent their value. As an example, they can be used to describe the difference in sales of a school or enrolments at a school before, during, and after the pandemic.

## Bubble charts
Bubble charts are another type of chart that shows the values as bubbles and the size of the bubbles represent the values. Bubble charts can be used for things like population and popularity comparisons between countries, brands, and celebrities respectively.
