# What is a database
Every single person in this world uses some kind of a database in their day to day lives sometimes even without knowing it. Like, when you upload a picture to a social media site or download or upload something from the internet.

In order for us to learn what a database is we first need to learn what data is. Data is the information about anything that tells us more about it like the color, engine, and the fuel type of a car is data about that can help you choose which type of car you want to buy.

It can also be digital information such as a person’s profile on a social media website like their email, username, when they joined the platform and etc.

Data is crucial information that is useful for multiple use-cases for both individuals and enterprises.  Before the dawn of computers people used paper registers and ledgers to note down the information they needed to save and now in the modern day world people use spreadsheets and databases to store their data.

Databases store data in a tabular structure that consists of rows and tables. This makes it easier to retrieve and manage large amounts of data. Tables aren’t the only way that a database can store data.

- Object-oriented databases store data in the form of objects and renders them as classes or sets.
- Graph databases store data in nodes and link different data together with edges.
- There are also databases that store data in JSON or similar key-value pair structures inside documents.

Databases are of many different kinds and store many different kinds of data but the databases themselves are stored either on cloud server or a physical server that is connected to the internal network or the computers that need to use it.
