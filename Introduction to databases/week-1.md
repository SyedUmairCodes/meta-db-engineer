# Introduction to databases
Databases are used in every digital application and all the information in the world is stored in some kind of a database. The importance of databases in real-life use cases are most of the time neglected since a lot of people don't know how important database engineering is in our modern-day world where everything needs to happen in a second.

The primary use of databases as the name suggest is to store data and different databases store different kinds and types of data. The database used in a bank is totally different from the one used to store data from a social media site. 

The huge rise of the IoT devices has led to a continuous stream of data that made advancements in database technologies necessary and real-time and graph databases were invented as well as the field of big-data in which data professionals’ study and work with data to make it more usable.
 
Whatever type of database there maybe they all do the same things if you look at it from an engineering perspective and that is to store data, form connections between different data, filter data, search data and allow engineers to manipulate the data. 

Some databases prefer speed over complex connections and some prefer vice versa. In order to choose the database that works best with your project you will need to analyze the requirements of the project and then choose the database that fulfills your criteria.
 
Databases and data itself are at the heart of all modern-day applications and if your system has a quick and reliable database then you and your user both will be happy since data can be stored easily and retrieved.

## What is a database
Every single person in this world uses some kind of a database in their day to day lives sometimes even without knowing it. Like, when you upload a picture to a social media site or download or upload something from the internet.

In order for us to learn what a database is we first need to learn what data is. Data is the information about anything that tells us more about it like the color, engine, and the fuel type of a car is data about that can help you choose which type of car you want to buy.

It can also be digital information such as a person’s profile on a social media website like their email, username, when they joined the platform and etc.

Data is crucial information that is useful for multiple use-cases for both individuals and enterprises.  Before the dawn of computers people used paper registers and ledgers to note down the information they needed to save and now in the modern day world people use spreadsheets and databases to store their data.

Databases store data in a tabular structure that consists of rows and tables. This makes it easier to retrieve and manage large amounts of data. Tables aren’t the only way that a database can store data.

- Object-oriented databases store data in the form of objects and renders them as classes or sets.
- Graph databases store data in nodes and link different data together with edges.
- There are also databases that store data in JSON or similar key-value pair structures inside documents.

Databases are of many different kinds and store many different kinds of data but the databases themselves are stored either on cloud server or a physical server that is connected to the internal network or the computers that need to use it.


# Relations in data
Data stored in isolation and disconnected from the rest is useless. It must have relations with other data so that it can be used for meaningful information and insights.

Data stored in one table can be related to data stored in another one.  The user details of a person can be linked to multiple details in the orders column of an online store’s database that lists all of the orders of that person.

Two or more people can share the same details like the first or last name so identifying a person in the database is done through a uniquely generated ID that is also called the primary key of the table.

Database engineers use these primary keys to connect different tables together. The primary of the customer table becomes the foreign key in the orders table since it’s from another table.

In the orders table, you can filter and see only the orders placed by the given customer ID. 

## Relational charts
Data comes from different sources and is of different kinds and in order to make sense of it and explain it to other people like customers, stakeholders, managers and other people we use data to create charts that help in explaining what story the data is trying to tell.

Charts can convey a great deal of information and can capture people’s attention in a way that helps them to make better decisions and take suitable actions.

### Bar charts
Bar charts are graphs that represent categorical data in rectangular bars and the height of the bars represent their value. As an example, they can be used to describe the difference in sales of a school or enrolments at a school before, during, and after the pandemic.

### Bubble charts
Bubble charts are another type of chart that shows the values as bubbles and the size of the bubbles represent the values. Bubble charts can be used for things like population and popularity comparisons between countries, brands, and celebrities respectively.

# Alternative databases
Databases designed to store and work with big-data have gone through major changes from storing large amounts of structured data to store the ever-increasing amount of unstructured data that is being produced all the time on a global scale.

Relational databases are also called SQL (structured query language) databases and have a lot of limitations when it comes to storing data from multiple sources, IoT devices and real-time data streams since all of this data comes in an unstructured format.

So, NoSQL databases were introduced, these databases can store data in a variety of formats and provide a flexible structure that makes scaling easier. NoSQL databases are used in social media sites, IoT devices and AI models as well as in any other application that deals or produces large amounts of unstructured data. Unlike SQL, NoSQL databases come in a variety of types that include document-based, graph-based, and key-value (JSON) based options.
